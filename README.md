I followed the exact instructions and it was fascinating. However, I can now see how different components are hard to tie together and among all of the settings and setup or implementation, it is hard. Essentially my changed feature design was that the character gets to fly in space however they prefer with no fear of death. This intentional mechanic is because there were complications for unknown reasons but it works nonetheless. Enjoy flight!
